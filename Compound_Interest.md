####Compound Interest:
#####Summary:

Compound interest is when the interest from the principal (initial investment) is added to the principal, and that from thereafter, that new amount is used as the principal in all future interest calculations. 

#####Traditional Usage:

Compound interest is commonly used in banking and finance, particularly in investments and loans. 

#####How it works:

Compound interest is affected by 2 factors:
- Rate
- Compounding Period

The rate is equivalent to the percent of the principal to add to itself. 

The compounding period specifies how often to add the interest (rate * principal) to the principal. 

The general formula for compound interest is A(t) = ((n + r) / n)^nt, where:
- A(t) = The amount at time
- n = number of compounding perids per year
- r = the compounding rate 

Similarly, the shorter the compounding period, the faster the money will grow. The most extreme example of this is continuous compounding, which is represented by A=Pe^(rt), where: 
- A = Amount earned
- P = Initial Principal
- r = Compounding rate in time units t
- t = Units of time

#####Edge Cases:

The higher the rate, the faster the money will grow. Each incremental unit causes a larger increase than the previous unit. 

The shorter the compouding period, the faster the money will grow. However, this has a logarithmic impact on money growth, meaning that a ceiling is met, i.e. continuous compounding. See the formula above.
